# midnightgames_3

Part 3 of the series called 'Midnight Games'. This one is loosely inspired by Wordle. 

How to Play: 
Guess the correct number in fewest attempts. For every number guessed, there will be hints. Get to the highest score you can. 

Possible future changes: 
- Make it more like wordle where players can only guess one daily. 
- Add more hints after more playtesting.
- Add attempts counter.
